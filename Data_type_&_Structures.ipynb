        "A dictionary is implemented as a **hash table**:\n",
        "1. **Hash Function**:\n",
        "   - Python computes a **hash value** for each key using a built-in hash function.\n",
        "   - The hash value determines where the key-value pair will be stored in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Buckets**:\n",
        "   - A hash table is a collection of \"buckets,\" and each bucket holds key-value pairs.\n",
        "   - The hash value is used to index into the hash table and locate the correct bucket for the key.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Collision Handling**:\n",
        "   - If two keys produce the same hash value (a hash collision), the dictionary resolves it using techniques like **open addressing** or **chaining**.\n",
        "   - In Python's implementation, dictionaries use open addressing with probing.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Dictionary Operations**\n",
        "- **Insertion**:\n",
        "  - When you add a new key-value pair, the key's hash is computed, and the key-value pair is placed in the appropriate bucket.\n",
        "  - If the key already exists, its value is updated.\n",
        "  \n",

        "  ```\n",

        "- **Lookup**:\n",
        "  - To retrieve a value, the dictionary computes the hash of the key and accesses the corresponding bucket.\n",

        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Deletion**:\n",
        "  - When a key is deleted, its bucket is marked as empty, and the dictionary adjusts to maintain efficiency.\n",

        "- Dictionaries dynamically resize their hash table when the number of elements grows beyond a certain threshold (to maintain efficiency).\n",

        "### **Advantages of Dictionaries**\n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Strings are Immutable by Design**\n",
        "Python's strings are implemented as sequences of characters stored in memory. **Immutability** ensures that once a string object is created, its memory content remains constant throughout its lifetime.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Reasons for String Immutability**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **A. Performance and Memory Optimization**\n",
        "- **String Interning**:\n",
        "  - Python optimizes memory usage by **interning** certain strings (e.g., short or frequently used strings).\n",
        "  - Immutable strings allow Python to safely reuse the same memory for identical strings, avoiding duplication.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Example**:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  str1 = \"hello\"\n",
        "  str2 = \"hello\"\n",
        "  print(id(str1) == id(str2))  # Output: True (both point to the same memory)\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **B. Hashability**\n",
        "- Strings are **hashable** because they are immutable. Hashable objects can generate a unique hash value, which is crucial for using strings as **keys in dictionaries** or elements in **sets**.\n",
        "- If strings were mutable, their hash values would change when their content is modified, making them unreliable for data structures like dictionaries and sets.\n",

        "#### **E. Consistency**\n",

        "### **Time Complexity for Key Access**\n",

In such cases, Python resolves the collision by storing the conflicting keys in a small linked list or another structure. Accessing the correct key then requires linear time in proportion to the number of collisions.\n",

        "**Lists** and **dictionaries** in Python have distinct structures and methods of retrieving data, each suited for different use cases. Here’s a comparison based on how data is accessed and the underlying mechanisms:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Retrieval by Index vs. Key**\n",
        "- **List**:\n",
        "  - Elements in a list are accessed by their **index**, which is an integer representing the position of the element in the list (zero-based).\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
        "    print(my_list[2])  # Output: 30\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  - **Performance**: Access by index is fast, with a time complexity of **O(1)** because the list uses contiguous memory allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dictionary**:\n",
        "  - Data in a dictionary is accessed by a unique **key**, not by position. Keys can be any hashable object (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    my_dict = {\"a\": 10, \"b\": 20, \"c\": 30}\n",
        "    print(my_dict[\"b\"])  # Output: 20\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  - **Performance**: Access by key is highly efficient, with an average time complexity of **O(1)**, thanks to its hash table implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Sequential Retrieval**\n",
        "- **List**:\n",
        "  - Lists are ideal for storing sequences of data where items need to be processed in order.\n",
        "  - You can iterate over all elements using a `for` loop or list comprehension.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
        "    for item in my_list:\n",
        "        print(item)\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  - **Performance**: Iterating through all elements takes **O(n)** time, where \\( n \\) is the number of elements in the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dictionary**:\n",
        "  - In dictionaries, you can iterate over **keys**, **values**, or **key-value pairs**.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    my_dict = {\"a\": 10, \"b\": 20, \"c\": 30}\n",
        "    for key, value in my_dict.items():\n",
        "        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  - **Performance**: Iterating through all keys, values, or items also takes **O(n)** time, but the underlying hash table structure makes individual lookups more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Handling Duplicate Values**\n",
        "- **List**:\n",
        "  - Lists can contain duplicate values, and retrieval can depend on the position of the duplicates.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    my_list = [10, 20, 20, 30]\n",
        "    print(my_list[1])  # Output: 20\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dictionary**:\n",
        "  - Dictionaries do not allow duplicate keys. If a key is repeated during assignment, the last value will overwrite the previous one.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    my_dict = {\"a\": 10, \"b\": 20, \"a\": 30}\n",
        "    print(my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 30, 'b': 20}\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Flexibility of Retrieval Criteria**\n",
        "- **List**:\n",
        "  - Retrieval is based purely on positional indices, which are integers.\n",
        "  - If you need to search for an item by value, you must manually iterate through the list, which is less efficient (\\(O(n)\\)).\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
        "    if 20 in my_list:\n",
        "        print(\"Found\")\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dictionary**:\n",
        "  - Retrieval is based on **keys**, which can be more descriptive and versatile than numeric indices.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
        "    print(my_dict[\"name\"])  # Output: Alice\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. Data Storage Structure**\n",
        "- **List**:\n",
        "  - Stores **values only**. If additional context is required (e.g., a label for each value), you'll need to pair lists or use indices.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    students = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"]  # No labels for each name\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dictionary**:\n",
        "  - Stores **key-value pairs**, which inherently provides more context for each value.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    students = {\"101\": \"Alice\", \"102\": \"Bob\", \"103\": \"Charlie\"}  # IDs as keys\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **6. Retrieval Use Cases**\n",
        "- **List**:\n",
        "  - Suitable for ordered collections, such as:\n",
        "    - Storing sequential data (e.g., time series).\n",
        "    - Iterating over all elements in a predictable sequence.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
